- 👋 Hi, I'm Nicholas Palceski,
  
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my foundational skills as a junior software engineering major at FGCU.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about computer security, databases using SQL, software testing and automation.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bigger projects with a team to build upon my existing knowledge and improve communication.
